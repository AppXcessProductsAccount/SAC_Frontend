/**
 * The one place an email address is judged, for every form that collects one.
 *
 * `<input type="email">` alone is not enough, which is why these forms looked
 * like they had no validation at all: the HTML5 rule requires only "something,
 * an @, something", so `abc@abc`, `a@b` and `name@localhost` all pass it and are
 * submitted happily. The server then rejects them — or worse, accepts an address
 * that no one can ever be reached at, which for a sign-in code or an enquiry
 * reply means the person simply never hears back.
 *
 * The check here is the practical one rather than the full RFC 5322 grammar:
 * exactly one @, a sane local part, and a real domain with a dotted, alphabetic
 * ending. RFC 5322 permits quoted strings, comments and bare hostnames that no
 * mail provider will actually issue, and accepting them here would only let
 * through addresses that cannot receive mail.
 *
 * The native `type="email"` attributes are deliberately left in place: they give
 * the mobile keyboard its @ key and catch the crudest mistakes before submit.
 * This runs on top of them.
