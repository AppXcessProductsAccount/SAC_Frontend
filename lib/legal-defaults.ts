 * This is BOTH the seed the database is loaded with and the fallback the page
 * renders when the CMS is unreachable, so the two cannot disagree. The same
 * wording is written into the database by
 * `backend/alembic/versions/*_seed_legal_pages.py` and by
 * `backend/alembic/seeds/seed_legal_pages.sql` — edit those alongside this file if the
 * default ever changes. Day-to-day edits belong in the admin, which overrides
 * all of this.
 *
 * These documents describe what this application actually collects and does:
 * name and contact details, the last four NRIC digits, health notes, an
 * emergency contact, and card payments taken through HitPay. They are a working
 * starting point written to match the system, not legal advice — have them
 * reviewed before relying on them.
